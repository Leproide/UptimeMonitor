# üñß Uptime Monitor (Local & External)

This project was created to **monitor random internet disconnections** (in my case, the unreliable OpenFiber Italy) and provide **documented proof** to your ISP, including timestamps and downtime duration.

## üîπ How It Works
The script comes in **two versions**:
- **Internal Network Monitoring:** Runs inside your local network, checking connectivity from your machine.
- **External Monitoring:** Runs from a **remote VPS or another location**, pinging your **public IP**.  
  - This allows you to **cross-check logs** from both locations, proving that the issue lies with your ISP and **not** your local network (LAN).

## üí° Why Use This?

‚úÖ Prove to your ISP that the issue is not your LAN, the main excuse for not investigating is "WiFi coverage or interference" or "cabling issues".

‚úÖ Monitor uptime/downtime with exact timestamps.

‚úÖ Receive instant notifications via Telegram or Gotify.

‚úÖ Works on Windows (PowerShell) & Linux (Bash).

### üì¢ **Notifications (Gotify & Telegram)**
The **external monitoring version** supports **Gotify** and **Telegram** notifications.  
- Get **real-time alerts** when your connection **goes down** or is **restored**.
- Fully **configurable** with simple parameters.

## üöÄ **Installation & Usage**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose Your Version**
- **Internal Monitoring:** Runs on your local machine.
- **External Monitoring:** Runs on a VPS or another remote system.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Script**
Modify the following parameters in the script to suit your setup.

# üîπ **For PowerShell (Windows)**
```powershell
# üåê Monitoring Target (IP to check for internet reachability)
$TARGET_IP = "8.8.8.8"
```
Use for example 8.8.8.8 for internal check and your public IP address for the external.

#### üì¢ Gotify parameters
```powershell
$GotifyToken = "CHANGE_ME"
$GotifyServer = "CHANGE_ME"
$GotifyPort = "CHANGE_ME"
$NOTIFY_ENABLED = $true  # Enable (true) or disable (false) Gotify notifications
```

#### üì¨ Telegram parameters
```powershell
$TELEGRAM_ENABLED = $true  # Enable (true) or disable (false) Telegram notifications
$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "CHANGE_ME"
$TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "CHANGE_ME"
```

# üîπ **For Bash (Linux)**

#### üåê Monitoring Target (IP to check for internet reachability)
```bash
TARGET_IP="8.8.8.8"
```
Use for example 8.8.8.8 for internal check and your public IP address for the external.

#### üì¢ Gotify parameters (modifiable for easy future management)
```bash
GotifyToken="CHANGE_ME"
GotifyServer="CHANGE_ME"
GotifyPort="CHANGE_ME"
```

#### Enable (true) or disable (false) Gotify notifications
```bash
NOTIFY_ENABLED=true
```

#### üì¨ Telegram parameters
```bash
TELEGRAM_ENABLED=true
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="CHANGE_ME"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="CHANGE_ME"
```

# üìú How It Works

- The script continuously checks internet connectivity by pinging the target IP (default: 8.8.8.8 for internal).
- If a disconnection is detected:
  - The timestamp is logged.
  - A Gotify/Telegram notification is sent (for the outside script if enabled).
  - The script waits for reconnection.
- Once reconnected:
  - The recovery timestamp and downtime duration are logged.
  - A Gotify/Telegram notification is sent (for the outside script if enabled).
  - Loop repeats indefinitely.

# üìù Log Example
```text
Disconnection detected: 10-02-2024 14:35:22
Reconnected at 10-02-2024 14:40:50 - Downtime duration: 00:05:28
```
